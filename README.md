# Matt's Branch

I am a undergraduate researcher at Fayetteville State University's Intelligent Systems Laboratory (ISL).  This branch pertains to ISL's IMPACT project-beginner team, and it consists of projects designed to improve my AI/ML competency.

<u>First beginner project</u> - Mars Image Classification Model.  The mars image classifier is a convolutional nueral network built using keras, consisting of multiple classes.
