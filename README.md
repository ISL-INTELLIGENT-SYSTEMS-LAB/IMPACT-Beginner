# IMPACT-Beginner

**Classifier tutorials/examples/etc:**

Please use the examples and tutorials under this to create the classifier(s). These include both Pytorch and Keras (you can use whichever you feel comfortable with):

These resources are helpful if you want more of an under-the-hood view (we're not using them to make the classifier; they're just for more insight if you want it). They go through making NNs only using Numpy:
